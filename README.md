# ECE 209AS AI on Chip

## Final Project

### Running [main] the project

1. Creating the datasets:

    The dataset is generated by running `import_data.ipynb`.
    The LP datasets must be extracted into the `dataset` folder in order for `import_data.ipynb` to read the files.
    The script will generate the `saved datasets` directory, containing the imported LP data.
